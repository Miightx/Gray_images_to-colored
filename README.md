Image processing is an interesting part of coding. In this project, we tried to colour a gray images using similar color images. The research [documentation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/262353941_Image_colorization_using_similar_images) gave us hint to make the colorization. In the trial, we used different methods of feature extractions and transfert the space color to our image.
